The following are the steps to use IntGet:

1- Create a folder in the C drive and name it: IntGet.

2- Download IntGet.exe into the C:\IntGet.

3- Inside C:\IntGet, create a folder and name it: input.

4- Run the Apktool (https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/) on the apk file of the application you would like to extract its Intent content.  

5- Put the result of step 4 into C:\IntGet\input.

6- Run IntGet.exe 

7- A text file (named "IntGet_output.text") with the result of IntGet will be created in  C:\IntGet.

7- Wait until IntGet_output.text is completely constructed: the end of a complete file reports the time taken to construct Intents.
